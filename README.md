## Personal Goals from this Projects

- Confidence using Rust's Lifetime system
- Understanding of common algorithms (we usually don't have to write them ourselvs, but I belive it is essential to know how they work to make good choices)
- Confidence in building my own libraries
- Understanding of the design decisions made in building useable algorithms

## FAQ

- Why do I use Rust for Data Structures?
  Rust is actually a really appropriate languages for Data Structures.
  Because it is such a low level language, where we can very clearly make decisions at pointer level.
  In addition, because of its memory safety features, we can do it absolutely confidently without being afraid of memory leaks.
